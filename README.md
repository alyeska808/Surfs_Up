# Surfs_Up

## Overview

The purpose here was to summarize temperature statistics for June and December. Utilizing weather data from a SQLite database, I employed Python, Numpy, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy with Jupyter Notebook to wrangle the requested information. This statistical data will help investors decide on opening an ice cream and surf shop in the beautiful state of Hawai'i.

## Results

* The standard deviation is very low for both June and December temperatures which shows great consistency and dependability for weather forecasting. 

* December can get almost 10째F cooler than June at its minimum temperature range.

* All around, the mean temperature between June and December is just a few degrees(째F) difference (June at 75째 and December at 71째).

## Summary 

Comparing the two different months with these descriptive statistics suggests the average temperatures are somewhat similar between June and December. An additional query I would perform to gather more weather data for these months would be precipitation levels. The amount of rainfall would impact surfing and ice cream consumption. I would also query indicators of extreme weather events. It would be interesting to note if hurricanes and other inclement weather phenomena were more likely to occur in June or December.
